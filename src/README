In order to build the source code successfully on Windows: 

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/pkgconfig

In order to run the executable, the directory containing Mingw32 DLL's
needs to be added to the PATH variable, eg, for Cygwin: 

  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin

This is something that should be handled by a Windows installer - the 
shipping product should include all required DLL's and install them to 
a sane location, and update the PATH variable accordingly)


TODO: 
-----------

   * compile using Visual Studio Express - see the notes here
     https://wiki.gnome.org/Attic/GtkmmWithMicrosoftVisualStudio
     more so for compatibility's sake than performance
