In order to build the source code successfully on Windows: 

  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/pkgconfig

In order to run the executable, the directory containing Mingw32 DLL's
needs to be added to the PATH variable, eg: 

  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin

(this is something that should be handled by a Windows installer)
